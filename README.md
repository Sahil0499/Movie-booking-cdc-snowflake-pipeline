# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Booking Real-Time CDC Aggregation with Snowflake

A real-time data pipeline that simulates change data capture (CDC) on movie booking data using Snowflake Streams, Dynamic Tables, and Tasks. The pipeline processes incoming records through a layered (Bronzeâ€“Silverâ€“Gold) architecture and visualizes live booking trends via a Streamlit dashboard powered by Snowpark.
