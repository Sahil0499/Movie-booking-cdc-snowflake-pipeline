# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Booking Real-Time CDC Aggregation with Snowflake

##  Acknowledgements
This project was built as part of hands-on learning to strengthen data engineering skills using Snowflakeâ€™s real-time features and visual analytics capabilities.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Snowflake** (Streams, Tasks, Dynamic Tables)
- **SQL**
- **Python**
- **Snowpark for Python**
- **Streamlit (in Snowflake)**

---

## Project Architecture
This project follows the Medallion Architecture pattern â€” a layered approach to organizing data transformations in Bronze, Silver, and Gold stages for better modularity, scalability, and data governance.

Bronze Table (CDC + Metadata)
   â†“ (Dynamic Table - Filtering)
Silver Table (Cleaned Data)

## Pipeline Flow
Raw Table
Stores raw movie booking data from simulated file ingestion.

CDC Stream + Bronze Layer
A Snowflake Stream captures changes and loads them to the Bronze table every 1 minute via a scheduled Task.

Silver Layer
A Dynamic Table filters and cleans the CDC-enriched data.

Gold Layer
Another Dynamic Table performs aggregations (e.g., total bookings per movie or time window), refreshing every 2 minutes.

Streamlit Dashboard
Built using Snowpark and Streamlit in Snowflake to visualize real-time booking metrics.

## Features
- Real-time CDC handling with Snowflake Streams
- Incremental data refresh using scheduled Tasks
- Implements the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronzeâ€“Silverâ€“Gold) using Snowflake Streams and Dynamic Tables
- Live dashboard using Streamlit inside Snowflake

---

## Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates how to:
- Build a real-time ingestion pipeline using Snowflake Streams and Tasks
- Implement Bronzeâ€“Silverâ€“Gold architecture using Dynamic Tables
- Visualize KPIs with Snowpark-powered Streamlit dashboards
- Simulate CDC processing and incremental ingestion without external tools
